# Basic Information-Form-in-Java-using-AWT---No-SWING
> Designing a GUI in java using only AWT(Abstract Window Tool)
 * You need to have an idea about AWT and component class.
 * AWT have three component class which are Frame, Window and Panel.
 * AWT have non component class which includes Button, TextField ,TextArea, CheckList, Choice , Label , Scroolbar, List ,Choice.
> Designing a Graphical User Interface for basic information details with a Submit button.
 * I have added a Submit button.
 * The GUI program contains setBound which is used to describe the location at which we want the particular component in a frame.
 * It has four field x, y , width and heigth.
> You need to have a basic understanding and knowledge of coordinates in frame to understand how the different component are placed in a 
frame using the integer values of x,y,width,height.

If you want to know more about awt, setBounds then go through this link https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html or watch some basic videos on youtube about awt, setbound.

> I have not included EventHandler which is EventAction and EventListening which is action that will be performed when you enter a Submit button. 
> That can be done using ActionEvent and ActionListener.

> This is a Simple GUI in AWT

> To include Event Handling there is already a concept of Swing.

> For that ones needs to put a step ahead but it is important to know  the fundamentals of awt. As AWT was introduced before and then Swing came with additional features.

 * There are some disadvantages in awt like it does not contain Password field, No frame exit open is there.
 
 * You can minimise or maximise the frame but frameonexit command is not there.
```
In order to destroy the frame one has to manually enter the command ctr+ c on their terminal.
```
#### This program will help to understand the beauty of awt and later to appreciate Swing framework. Then with the help of Swing framework one can play more with GUI and could overcome the disadvantages that AWT possess.

I have added the hexadecimal color to make GUI more beautiful.
